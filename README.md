# Guess-the-author-of-the-quote
In this game, I used Beautiful soup to scrap the quotes from a quotes website.
Along with the author's name and their complete information. Player will be given a random quote and then they have to guess the name of the author of that quote. 
The game will give various hints after each wrong guess. After all wrong guesses, game will automatically tell the correct answer. 
This project has  helped me to know the capability of beautiful soup to scarp the data from the websites.
 Scrapping data along managing and saving it in a file was undoubtedly a good experience.
