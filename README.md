# Guess-the-author-of-the-quote
In this game  I used Beautifullsoup to scrap the quotes from a quotes site. along with author name and their full information.
so you'll be given a random quote and then you've to guess the name of the author of that quote.
the game will give you different hints after your each wrong guess.
after all wronng guesses the game will automatically tell you the right answer.
this project really helped me to know the power of the beautiful soup to scrap the data from the websites.
scrappping data
managing it
saving it in a file
a good experience
